emmet?
hello world-html
hello world-js
put script tag in body at last
in react hello world?
add cdn links- inject react to project
what is cdn?
what is crossorigin?
after adding cdn links we see in console if we write react. and see lot of functions exported from react code.
there are 2 cdn files- core react and for dom operations.
why two? because react is used in browsers, phones hence dom s different.
we have a element in doom make it as react root and then render elements on to that root.
there are 2 params in the React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello") here {} actually takes attributes like id="heading"
this heading is a react object.
nested div in react
two siblings-array
the structure becomes messy using react.createElement so we use jsx.
order of file <script>cdn before the app.js
root.render-> replace anyhing that is in root html
react only works at root if i write root.render()
